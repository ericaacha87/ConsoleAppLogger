Code Review / Refactoring exercise

Please review the following code snippet. Assume that all referenced assemblies have
been properly included.

The code is used to log different messages throughout an application. We want the ability
to be able to log to a text file, the console and/or the database. Messages can be marked
as message, warning or error. We also want the ability to selectively be able to choose
what gets logged, such as to be able to log only errors or only errors and warnings.

	1. If you were to review the following code, what feedback would you give? Please be
specific and indicate any errors that would occur as well as other best practices and
code refactoring that should be done.
	2. Rewrite the code based on the feedback you provided in question 1. Please include
unit tests on your code.
